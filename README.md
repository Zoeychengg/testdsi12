# Project Title

To increase the Participation rate of SAT

## Motivation of project

We would like to make observations and take a look at the possible reccomendation to increase the Participation rate of students taking the SAT test in states with lower participation rate.

## Conclusion and recommendation
In order to increase the Participation rate, the most feasible way is to implement fee waiver & SAT School Day initiatives to the lower participating states.
As we can see that states & districts with the initiatives implemented has a higher participation rate, and states who just implemented the initiatives has a drastic increase in their participation rate.
